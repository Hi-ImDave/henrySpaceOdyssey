# henrySpaceOdyssey

Henry's Space Odyssey (HSO) is a personal project I am working on for my nephew, Henry. He has a deep interest in both space and NASA, and hopes to one day work for NASA. I thought it would be fun if he had his own website he could go to view pictures, and learn about space. HSO is currently integrated with a handful of NASA API's, including the Astrological Picture of the Day API (APOD), the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera API (EPIC) and the MARS Rover API.
