## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA API

This was my first attempt at building a full-stack web application from scratch. I used this project to get a better understanding of DOM manipulation and working with API's.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project I would set the input to date format for a better UX by allowing users to choose a date from the calendar instead of entering manually.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that creating a successful project, isn't determined by it's complexity.
